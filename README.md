# VisionVerify: Rephotographed Image Detection using YOLOv8
## Overview
VisionVerify is a deep learning-based solution designed to improve biometric security by detecting rephotographed (spoofed) images. The system distinguishes between live images and spoofed ones, which are typically used in presentation attacks during digital onboarding or KYC (Know Your Customer) processes.

We adapted YOLOv8, originally an object detection model, into a full-image binary classifier. This approach enables high-speed, accurate predictions, even when using lightweight versions such as YOLOv8n, making it suitable for real-time deployment.

## Motivation
Identity verification systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks where printed or screen-captured images are used to impersonate real individuals. Manual verification is often inefficient and unreliable. VisionVerify aims to automate this verification process by accurately detecting these spoofing attempts, helping reduce fraud in digital services.

## Methodology
### Model Adaptation
Repurposed YOLOv8 for binary classification rather than object detection.

Trained the model to classify input images as either:

Live (genuine)

Spoofed (rephotographed)

### Dataset Creation
A custom dataset was developed specifically for this task:

Live images were collected from diverse users in varying environments and lighting conditions.

Spoofed images were generated by rephotographing the live images from screens (phones, laptops, etc.) to simulate real-world attack scenarios.

This approach helped the model learn subtle visual patterns that differentiate live photos from rephotographed ones.

### Baseline Comparisons
To validate the effectiveness of our YOLOv8-based approach, we also implemented and evaluated traditional classifiers such as:

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Random Forests

YOLOv8 significantly outperformed these models, especially in terms of generalization and real-time inference capabilities.

## Results
High accuracy, precision, and recall on the custom dataset.

Strong performance on previously unseen spoofing techniques.

Efficient inference using the YOLOv8n model variant, suitable for low-latency applications.

## Tech Stack
Python

YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

PyTorch

OpenCV

scikit-learn (for baseline models)

## Future Work
Expanding the dataset across more environments, devices, and user profiles.

Performing cross-domain evaluation to improve robustness.

Model optimization for deployment on edge devices.

Integration into real-time KYC and biometric verification pipelines.
